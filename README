Hi, in the archive you will find the source for the start of a dBase and
Clipper style DBF reader class. I should point out that this is the first
bit of Java code I've done and it was started as a test more than anything
else, it is not intended to be working code.

However, a couple of people have asked to see it so I'm making it available
to anyone who wants to see it, play with it, improve it etc.

Note that there is a lot wrong with it, and a lot would need to be done
to it before it would be a usable class. The test program works, and 
that is the only claim I'm going to make. :-)

Let me know what you think, if you take the code and add to it then please
let me know, I'd like to see what you come up with. I should be doing some
more work on it soon, I do hope to get it fully working at some point.
